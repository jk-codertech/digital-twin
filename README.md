- **🤖 Bot Detection**: Automated behavior detection and prevention
- **💳 Session Management**: Browser fingerprinting and violation tracking
- **✅ Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation and sanitization
- **🗺️ Zero Client Trust**: All business logic is server-authoritative
- **📜 Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all requests and security events
- **👥 Admin Controls**: Real-time monitoring and session management
- **🛡️ Attack Prevention**: Protection against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and replay attacks

### 📊 Monitoring & Administration
- **📈 Real-time Statistics**: Security events, active sessions, and violation tracking

## 🔒 Security

This application implements enterprise-grade security measures. For detailed information, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

### Quick Security Overview
- **Rate Limiting**: 100ms between requests, 100 requests per 10-second window
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive blocking for violations (60s to 24h)
- **Bot Detection**: Sub-50ms requests trigger automation detection
- **Input Validation**: Whitelist-based validation with injection prevention
- **Session Tracking**: Browser fingerprinting with violation monitoring
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all requests and security events

## 🧪 Testing Security

### Multi-User Testing
1. Open the application in multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Click increment/decrement buttons in different tabs
3. Observe real-time synchronization across all instances
4. Test rapid clicking to see rate limiting in action

### Security Testing
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..20}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/increment & done

# Monitor security events in Convex dashboard
# Try automated clicking patterns
# Test with different user agents
```
